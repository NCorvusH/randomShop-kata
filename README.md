### Kata Description:

**What do we sell?**

At Random Shop, we embrace chaos as our hallmark. When customers visit our store, we want them to feel completely lost and unsure of what they're going to buy (or how much they're going to pay for it). Currently, our stock consists of pets, gourmet products, Magic cards, and outlet footwear.

**Pricing:**

**Magic: The Gathering Cards:** These cards have variable prices based on their color:
- Blue: 5 euros
- Red: 3.5 euros
- Green: 4.40 euros
- Black: 6.80 euros
- Brown: 2.0 euros
The Black Lotus, a collector's card, is priced at 40,000 euros.

**Pets:** The price of pets depends on their number of legs and color:
- Land animals: 4.2 euros per leg
- Fish: Pricing varies by color: 10 cents for blue fish, 100 euros for goldfish, and a base price for other fish.

**Gourmet Products:** The price of these products depends on their "age":
- Wines: 20 euros per year
- Stinky cheeses: 10 euros per year

**Customer Requests:**

**Magic Card Modification:** The age of Magic cards can influence their price:
- Blue and red cards are half-price when they are over 10 years old.
- Black and green cards cost 20% more when they are over 20 years old.

**Pet Spiders:** We want to add this new product to our store. The price of a pet spider is calculated as follows:
- 1.20 euros per leg
- +2 euros if the spider is red, +3 euros if it is gold
- Stinky spiders are half-price.
